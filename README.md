## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
### Game Won't Compile?
Make sure the ICBYTES framework is correctly placed on your local disk.
Ensure all required assets (images, sounds, and .lib files) are in the correct directories.
Try running the game in Debug Mode first.
### Game Doesn't Start?
If you see a missing file error, check if Debug.lib and Release.lib exist in the game directory.
Some antivirus programs might flag the .exe file as unknown—try allowing it in your settings.
